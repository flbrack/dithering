# Dithering

Some basic dithering algorithms implemented in Go. Inspired by this [HTTP 203 episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS0Gck00nDw) and the accompanying [blog post](https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/).

The pics folder contains some results on a picture of my bike before it got stolen :(.
